# Seed Variance Experiment Configuration
# Probing superposition geometry via LoRA optimization trajectories

experiment:
  name: seed-variance
  hypothesis: |
    The shape of the leakage distribution across seeds reveals the geometry
    of how "archaic vocabulary" and "historical persona" are superposed in
    the base model's representation space.
