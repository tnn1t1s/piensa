/Users/palaitis/Development/piensa/tools/bin/review-methods:39: DeprecationWarning: `OpenAIModel` was renamed to `OpenAIChatModel` to clearly distinguish it from `OpenAIResponsesModel` which uses OpenAI's newer Responses API. Use that unless you're using an OpenAI Chat Completions-compatible API, or require a feature that the Responses API doesn't support yet like audio.

## Methods & Reproducibility Review

### Experimental Design Clarity
**Clear** - The 4×4×2 factorial design is well-specified with clear operationalization of matched/mismatched conditions. The hypothesis mapping (matched=L1, mismatched=L2) is explicit and testable.

### Adapter Training Details
**Clear** - LoRA configuration is fully specified (rank=8, alpha=16, lr=1e-5, 100 iterations). Training data sources and sample sizes are documented with final validation losses reported.

**Note**: The brief training (100 iterations) is acknowledged as a limitation. Validation loss convergence is not discussed - this could affect adapter quality consistency.

### Inference Parameters
**Clear** - Temperature=0.7, 50 trials per condition specified. Model version (Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, 4-bit quantized) clearly identified.

### Response Classification Rules
**Clear** - Three-category classification system (A/B/Unclear) with explicit decision rules:
- A: Contains only "A" or starts with "A" with no "B"  
- B: Contains only "B" or starts with "B" with no "A"
- Unclear: Both mentioned, neither mentioned, or verbose explanation

**Interpretability Risk**: The classification rules appear robust, but edge cases (e.g., "A is better but I choose B") are not addressed. Manual taxonomy of unclear responses in Section 4.1 adds confidence.

### Unclear-Rate Handling
**Needs Clarification** - The paper correctly flags that framing effects are uninterpretable when unclear rates exceed 50%, but the threshold choice (50%) is not justified. 

**Critical Gap**: How are unclear responses excluded from P(A|gain) and P(A|loss) calculations? The denominator for probability calculations is ambiguous - are percentages calculated over all 50 trials or only clear responses?

**Example**: ZH adapter + EN prompt shows "6% choose A, 2% choose B" with 96% unclear. This suggests calculation over all trials, but this should be explicit.

### Potential Bias Sources
**Flagged Issues**:

1. **Translation Quality Asymmetry**: Hebrew prompts are GPT-4o translated while others use native datasets. This could systematically affect response patterns.

2. **Training Data Imbalance**: Sample sizes vary (4,750-5,000) and validation losses differ substantially (0.93-1.17), suggesting uneven adapter quality.

3. **Quantization Effects**: 4-bit quantization could interact differently with language-specific adapters, but this is not controlled.

### Replication Feasibility
**Clear** - All datasets are identified, LoRA parameters specified, and prompts provided in full for all four languages. Model version and inference settings enable replication.

**Minor Gap**: Exact prompt formatting/templating not shown (e.g., system prompts, conversation structure).

### Result Interpretability Boundaries
**Well-Handled** - The paper clearly delineates:
- Conditions with interpretable data (low unclear rates)
- Conditions where evaluation failed (high unclear rates)  
- Two distinct failure modes: hypothesis failure vs. evaluation failure

**Strength**: Table 1 footnote appropriately warns against interpreting framing effects when unclear rates exceed 50%.

### Critical Methodological Insight
The paper raises an important meta-question about the original Costa et al. study: "what proportion of human participants gave unclear or invalid responses?" This highlights how computational replications can expose unreported methodological details in original studies.

### Overall Assessment
**Reproducible with Clear Limitations** - The experimental design is sufficiently detailed for replication. The main interpretability risk is the unclear-rate calculation ambiguity, but the authors appropriately flag conditions where results are uninterpretable. The separation of hypothesis failure from evaluation failure is methodologically sound.

**Recommendation**: Clarify probability calculation denominators and consider reporting confidence intervals given the small sample size (n=50) and high-temperature sampling.
