## Skeptical Cognitive Science Review: Human-Paradigm Stress Test

From a cognitive science perspective, the following points may raise concern regarding the interpretive framing of this work:

### 1. The L1/L2 Operationalization Lacks Theoretical Grounding

The paper assumes that LoRA adapter-prompt matching can serve as a proxy for human L1/L2 processing, but this analogy is undertheorized. The Foreign Language Effect in humans emerges from *developmental* and *embodied* language acquisition: L1 is acquired through emotionally charged, socially embedded interactions during a critical period, creating deep associations between linguistic forms and affective states. L2, typically acquired later and through explicit instruction, lacks these embodied emotional traces.

A LoRA adapter trained on 5,000 instruction-following samples for 100 iterations creates no analogous asymmetry. The paper acknowledges this in passing (Section 5.2) but frames the work as testing a "hypothesis" when the theoretical basis for expecting adapter matching to produce L1-like processing was always tenuous. A more cautious framing would present this as an *exploratory probe* rather than a hypothesis test, since the mapping between the human phenomenon and the computational manipulation was speculative from the outset.

### 2. The Costa et al. Study May Be Subtly Mischaracterized

The paper correctly summarizes Costa et al.'s findings but may overstate the mechanistic clarity of the original work. Costa et al. (2014) proposed emotional distance as *one* explanatory account, but the human literature remains contested. Some evidence suggests the FLE operates via increased cognitive load and deliberation rather than purely reduced emotionality (see the heterogeneity documented in Circi et al., 2021, which the paper cites). By focusing primarily on the "emotional resonance" account, the paper sets up an implicit prediction—that any processing asymmetry should produce the effect—that the original literature does not fully support.

This matters because the negative finding is interpreted as evidence against the operationalization, but if the human mechanism is itself uncertain, the absence of the effect in LLMs could reflect either (a) a failed operationalization or (b) the absence of whatever psychological substrate actually drives the human effect. The paper conflates these possibilities.

### 3. The "Stronger Framing in Mismatched Conditions" Finding Has Alternative Explanations

The paper emphasizes that the EN adapter showed *weaker* framing in the matched condition (54%) than in mismatched conditions (ES: 70%, HE: 76%), treating this as evidence against the FLE hypothesis. However, this pattern admits simpler explanations:

- **Cross-linguistic prompt difficulty**: Hebrew and Spanish prompts may be processed with more surface-level pattern matching by an English-specialized model, leading to more stereotyped responses. The "certain option in gains, risky in losses" pattern is heavily represented in training data discussing the Asian Disease problem specifically. Mismatched prompts might *increase* reliance on shallow heuristics rather than simulate L2 deliberation.

- **Response distribution artifacts**: With only 50 trials per condition at temperature=0.7, a 16-point difference (54% vs. 70%) represents approximately 8 response flips—within the range of sampling variability. No statistical tests are reported comparing matched vs. mismatched conditions.

The paper's interpretive leap from "mismatched > matched" to "opposite of FLE prediction" assumes the operationalization was valid in the first place, which is the very question under investigation.

### 4. The Unclear Response Critique of Costa et al. Is Asymmetrically Applied

The paper's methodological note—questioning whether Costa et al. reported exclusion rates for unclear responses—is reasonable but risks false equivalence. In human studies, participants undergo comprehension checks, are typically excluded if they fail attention checks, and rarely produce responses that are uninterpretable in the way LLM outputs can be (e.g., verbose explanations, language mixing, format non-compliance).

The paper states: "The original paper does not report this." However, standard practice in human behavioral research involves inclusion criteria (language proficiency thresholds, comprehension verification) applied *before* analysis. Comparing LLM non-compliance rates of 98% to unreported human exclusion rates implies a symmetry that likely does not exist. If the paper wishes to make this comparison, it should acknowledge that human studies operate within a different validity framework where response interpretability is typically ensured by design.

### 5. The Framing Effect Replication Claim May Be Overstated

The paper claims to "replicate" the framing effect in LLMs, but several conditions showed P(A|loss) values so low (2-4%) that nearly all responses were B under loss framing regardless of condition. This floor effect makes the "framing effect" partially a ceiling/floor artifact rather than a demonstration of systematic preference reversal. A more cautious interpretation would note that the model shows strong option A preference in gain frames and moderate-to-strong option B preference in loss frames, without claiming this constitutes replication of the human phenomenon in any deep sense.

### 6. Missing Engagement with Probability Comprehension

A known confound in human framing effect studies—and one Costa et al. grappled with—is whether participants correctly process probabilistic information. The Asian Disease problem requires understanding that "33.3% chance of saving 600,000" has the same expected value as "200,000 saved with certainty." Human studies control for numeracy; LLM studies rarely do.

The paper does not address whether the model's responses reflect genuine risk preference shifts or differential probability comprehension across languages. The Chinese adapter's matched condition showed the weakest framing effect (30%)—is this because Chinese prompts are processed differently, or because the probability format ("33.3%的概率") is tokenized/processed differently than in English? This alternative explanation goes unexplored.

### Summary Assessment

The paper is methodologically transparent about its limitations and appropriately cautious in its central conclusions. However, the framing of the work as a "hypothesis test" of an FLE operationalization may overstate the theoretical warrant for expecting adapter-based matching to produce the effect. The interpretation of the negative result—particularly the "opposite direction" finding—could benefit from more explicit consideration of alternative explanations unrelated to L1/L2 processing.

The critique of Costa et al.'s non-reporting of exclusion rates, while methodologically interesting, risks implying a symmetry between human and LLM validity concerns that may not be justified. A CogSci reader skeptical of LLM-human analogies would likely find the paper's core claims appropriately hedged, but might wish for more explicit acknowledgment that the operationalization was *a priori* weakly motivated by the human literature.
