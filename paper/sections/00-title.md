  The Foreign Language Effect (FLE) describes reduced cognitive biases when people reason in a second language. We test whether language-specific LoRA adapters can operationalize L1/L2-like processing asymmetries in LLMs, using the Asian Disease framing task across a 4×4 design: four adapter languages (English, Spanish, Hebrew, Chinese) crossed with four prompt languages. All 16 conditions showed differential response patterns between gain and loss frames (+6% to +62%), showing the same directional asymmetry as reported in Tversky & Kahneman (1981): higher selection rates for the certain option under gain framing. We measure choice frequencies in a forced-choice task, not cognitive biases, emotional processing, or reasoning mode. Results provide mixed evidence for the adapter-based operationalization: the English adapter showed a gradient consistent with predictions (matched condition highest), but Hebrew and Chinese adapters showed stronger framing with Spanish prompts than matched conditions. Spanish prompts produced the largest effects across all adapters (mean Δ=48.5%), while the Spanish adapter exhibited anomalous risk-seeking on English prompts that raises questions about operationalization validity. We contribute a methodological finding that role-binding prefixes yield 0-4% unclear response rates in forced-choice LLM paradigms.
