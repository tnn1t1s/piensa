  The Foreign Language Effect (FLE) describes reduced cognitive biases when people reason in a second language. We test whether language-specific LoRA adapters can operationalize L1/L2-like processing asymmetries in LLMs, using the Asian Disease framing task across a 4×4 design: four adapter languages (English, Spanish, Hebrew, Chinese) crossed with four prompt languages. All 16 conditions showed positive framing effects (+6% to +62%), indicating that Mistral-7B produces response patterns consistent with the classic Tversky-Kahneman findings in this task. Results provide mixed evidence for the adapter-based operationalization: the English adapter showed a gradient consistent with predictions (matched condition highest), but Hebrew and Chinese adapters showed stronger framing with Spanish prompts than matched conditions. Spanish prompts produced the largest effects across all adapters (mean Δ=48.5%), while the Spanish adapter exhibited anomalous risk-seeking on English prompts. We contribute a methodological finding that role-binding prefixes yield 0-4% unclear response rates in forced-choice LLM paradigms.
