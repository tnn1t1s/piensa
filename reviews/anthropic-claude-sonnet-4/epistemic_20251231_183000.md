# Epistemic Hygiene Review: Claim-Scope Audit

## Overreaching Claims Identified:

• **"Costa et al. (2014) demonstrated that humans exhibit reduced cognitive biases when reasoning in a foreign language"**
  - Overreach: Implies universal mechanism across all humans and biases
  - Suggested rewrite: "Costa et al. (2014) found that their bilingual participants exhibited reduced framing effects in specific decision-making tasks when using their second language"

• **"The theoretical explanation centers on emotional distance: L2 processing is more effortful and less emotionally resonant than L1 processing"**
  - Overreach: States mechanism as fact rather than hypothesis; generalizes beyond what Costa et al. measured
  - Suggested rewrite: "Costa et al. proposed that reduced emotional engagement during L2 processing might explain their observed pattern"

• **"This reduced emotional engagement dampens the gut reactions that drive many cognitive biases"**
  - Overreach: Claims causal mechanism not directly measured in the cited study
  - Suggested rewrite: "Costa et al. hypothesized this might reduce automatic responses associated with some decision-making biases"

• **"Unlike humans, LLMs do not have a developmental L1 acquired in childhood through emotional and social interaction"**
  - Overreach: Makes claims about human development mechanisms not tested in the cited work
  - Suggested rewrite: "Unlike the bilingual participants in Costa et al.'s study, LLMs lack the developmental language acquisition history that may underlie L1/L2 processing differences"

• **"The dominant explanatory account attributes the FLE to reduced emotional engagement"**
  - Overreach: Implies consensus on mechanism rather than hypothesis
  - Suggested rewrite: "Several researchers have proposed that reduced emotional engagement may contribute to the FLE pattern"

• **"human studies typically report choice distributions over included trials but do not systematically report rates of misunderstanding, invalid responses, or exclusions"**
  - Overreach: Universal claim about reporting practices across all human studies
  - Suggested rewrite: "The reviewed human FLE studies, including Costa et al., do not report rates of invalid responses or exclusions"

• **"These findings suggest that aggregate choice patterns in LLMs can resemble those observed in human decision-making"**
  - Overreach: Generalizes from surface similarity to deeper parallel
  - Suggested rewrite: "These studies found that LLMs' response distributions matched the directional patterns observed in human framing experiments"

• **"multilingual models often rely on internal normalization or translation mechanisms rather than maintaining fully independent language-specific reasoning pathways"**
  - Overreach: Claims knowledge of internal mechanisms not directly measured
  - Suggested rewrite: "Studies suggest that observed cross-lingual differences in LLM outputs may reflect surface-level processing rather than distinct reasoning modes"

• **"The base model's training distribution.** Mistral-7B was trained predominantly on English. Adding a Spanish adapter may add a capability layer rather than displacing English as the default processing mode."**
  - Overreach: Makes claims about internal processing modes not measured
  - Suggested rewrite: "Mistral-7B's English-heavy training data means the Spanish adapter may enhance Spanish output capability without creating the processing asymmetries our operationalization intended to capture"

• **"LoRA modifies capabilities, not processing style"**
  - Overreach: States mechanism as fact rather than interpretation
  - Suggested rewrite: "In our experiment, LoRA adaptation appeared to modify output capabilities rather than creating the processing differences we hypothesized"

• **"what proportion of human participants gave unclear or invalid responses? The original paper does not report this"**
  - Overreach: Implies this is a criticism of the original study without establishing relevance
  - Suggested rewrite: "For comparison with our unclear response rates, we note that Costa et al. did not report the proportion of participant responses that were unclear or invalid"

## Key Rhetorical Drift Patterns:

• **Mechanism collapse**: Repeatedly conflating hypothesized mechanisms (emotional distance, processing fluency) with measured outcomes (choice patterns)

• **Scope inflation**: Moving from "Costa et al. found X in their specific paradigm" to "humans exhibit Y" or "the FLE demonstrates Z"

• **Evaluation conflation**: Not clearly separating proxy failure (LoRA doesn't create L1/L2 distinction) from evaluation failure (unclear responses prevent measurement)

## Overall Assessment:
The paper needs systematic scope-narrowing to ensure claims match what was actually measured. The negative findings are appropriately cautious, but the background and interpretation sections make unsupported leaps about mechanisms and generalizability.
