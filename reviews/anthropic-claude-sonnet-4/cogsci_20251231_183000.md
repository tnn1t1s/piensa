From a cognitive science perspective, the following points may raise concern about how this paper frames and interprets human bilingual cognition research:

**Characterization of the Foreign Language Effect Literature**

The paper presents Costa et al. (2014) as establishing a clear, unified phenomenon, but the FLE literature is considerably more heterogeneous than suggested. The authors briefly mention "substantial heterogeneity in effect size" in meta-analyses but don't adequately convey that the FLE often fails to replicate, varies dramatically across populations, and may be task-specific rather than reflecting a general cognitive mechanism. The paper would benefit from acknowledging that even within human research, the FLE is an active area of debate rather than settled science.

**Oversimplified Theoretical Framework** 

The paper reduces the theoretical explanation for the FLE to "emotional distance" and "effortful L2 processing," but this misses important nuances in the bilingual cognition literature. Current theories emphasize that L2 effects depend heavily on proficiency levels, age of acquisition, cultural associations with each language, and domain-specific expertise. The binary L1/L2 distinction used here doesn't capture these continuous variables that moderate the effect in humans.

**Questionable LLM-Human Analogies**

The core premise—that LoRA adapters can meaningfully simulate human L1/L2 processing differences—deserves more skeptical treatment. Humans acquire languages through embodied social interaction over years, creating deep associations between language and emotional/experiential memories. The paper assumes this can be approximated by statistical fine-tuning on text corpora, but provides little justification for why this should create psychologically meaningful processing differences.

**Alternative Explanations Under-Explored**

When the English adapter shows stronger framing effects in "foreign" language prompts, the paper concludes this contradicts the FLE hypothesis. However, this could reflect task difficulty rather than L1/L2 processing. The model may simply perform less reliably when processing non-English prompts with an English adapter, leading to more variable (and apparently more biased) responses. This is a methodological artifact, not evidence against the FLE.

**Response Validity Comparison**

The paper repeatedly questions why Costa et al. didn't report "unclear or invalid responses" from human participants. This comparison is problematic because human unclear responses (asking for clarification, expressing confusion) are qualitatively different from LLM instruction-following failures (generating verbose explanations instead of A/B choices). The paper treats these as equivalent methodological oversights when they reflect fundamentally different types of experimental challenges.

**Scope of Claims**

While the paper appropriately restricts its conclusions to the specific operationalization tested, it occasionally implies broader skepticism about LLM-FLE connections. The negative result tells us that this particular technical approach doesn't work—it doesn't provide evidence for or against whether other approaches might successfully capture FLE-like effects in language models.

Despite these concerns, the paper's core empirical work is methodologically sound, and the authors are generally careful to acknowledge their operationalization's limitations. The framing could be more neutral toward the human literature while still presenting their computational approach as a reasonable first attempt at testing FLE-like effects in LLMs.
